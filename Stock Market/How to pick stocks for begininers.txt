      Then belief will be their that it will give atleast this much of return.
  3- terms of trades -> If company doing business and collecting money when ?
                                                                         1- on spot 2- after 30 days 3- collecting in cash etc..

     It shows strength of company , it gives cash flow***

	CASH FLOW MAKES EVERYTHING HIGH
